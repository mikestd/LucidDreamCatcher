# LucidDreamCatcher
  When we are dreaming, we look at the viewer who is watching a movie. This program will be directed by his own dreams. We want to go to another planet? You are welcome! Or learn how to build pyramids in Egypt? Very well! How about to look into the future? And this is possible! Or maybe someone wants to see long-gone loved ones? In the world of dreams, through the mirror of the world, everything is possible! Even to make a discovery of global scale, such as Mendeleev's famous table. To get this amazing state need only remember what you want to get there, you have to have the intention and awareness. For this we need to practice. For more information about this project you may read in Wiki.
